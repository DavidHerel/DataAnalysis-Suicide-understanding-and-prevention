# Suicide-understanding-and-prevention
Identify signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts/subgroups

Notebook is written in R. However - it can be rendered in HTML

# Key notes
- suicide rate is decreasing over time (until pandemic hit, but dataset is only 1986-2015)
- male 2x higher probability of commiting suicide
- higher age -> higher change of suicide
...etc

Nice charts and graphs can be seen in notebook :)
